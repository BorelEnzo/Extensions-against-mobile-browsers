## Attacking mobile browsers with extensions

This repository contains proofs of concept showcasing how to attack mobile browsers with extensions. It is a well-known fact that browser extensions could cause severe harm to a browser, as they are like privileged UXSS (Universal Cross-Site Scripting).  

This work is related to the Thesis I wrote for my Master's degree in Cybersecurity in 2020. The full document will be available soon.

In each folder, you'll find a minimal working example as well as an explanation of the attack

### Future work

The code was tested on Fennec (Firefox Android) and Kiwi Browser (Android). As it contains proofs of concepts, some style sheets or code were written according to a specific website and are not generic.  
Moreover, some attacks rely on bugs that we reported and should be patched soon, if not already done.

_Coming soon_:
